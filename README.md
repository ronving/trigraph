## Task

Trigraph - three-letter composite written character.
Write a program that reads data from a text file and prints the complete list of trigraphs inside it, as well as the number of times each trigraph is repeated. A trigraph should only contain letters; sequences of characters that contain spaces or punctuation marks should not be counted. Uppercase and lowercase characters are not separated. The answer should be printed in capital letters.


Trigraphs must be listed in **alphabetical order**.

## For Example
**Input**

```bash
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.
```

**Output**

```java
BLU = 1
FIS = 4
ISH = 4
LUE = 1
ONE = 1
RED = 1
TWO = 1
```
